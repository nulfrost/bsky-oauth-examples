# Bluesky OAuth Examples

A lot of people that are building applications on atproto ask about how to implement OAuth and I usually send them existing applications or minimal examples in the framework/language they're working in. I want this repository to serve as a place where people can easuly find minimal examples to bootstrap from if they wondering how to implement OAuth.

It would be nice to just link to minimal examples to make it easy for people to quickly scan for the pieces they need to add their applications but I won't say no to bigger applications. The more examples the better.
